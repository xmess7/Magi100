# Magi100

UPDATE(2020.07.02):
Version 12. Added emaPERIOD input.  Users can now change the ema period.

Hey folks for now I am leaving the project as iz (now version 12). Version 7 is still available in case you have issues with version 12 :).
Version 7 was the last working version but it does use more memory/cpu.  Some of you will not notice this but for those running other EAs/Indicators, depending on how much 
you are running you may see some affect in performance..

I am running version 12 24/7 in order to keep track of performance. If anything is noted I will updated it and release it.
I will be back to do more fun stuff....  :)
